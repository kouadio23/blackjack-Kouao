# Overview
This program lets the user play Blackjack.  The computer
acts as the dealer.  The user has a stake of $100, and
makes a bet on each game.  The user can leave at any time,
or will be kicked out when he loses all the money.
House rules:  The dealer hits on a total of 16 or less
and stands on a total of 17 or more.  Dealer wins ties.
A new deck of cards is used for each game.
